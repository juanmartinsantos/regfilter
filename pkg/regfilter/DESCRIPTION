Description: Traditional noise filtering methods aim at removing noisy samples from a classification dataset. This package adapts classic and recent filtering techniques to be used in regression problems. To do this, it uses the approach proposed in Martin (2021) [<doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123151>]. Thus, the goal of the implemented noise filters is to eliminate samples with noise in regression datasets.
