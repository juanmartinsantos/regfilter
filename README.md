# regfilter (Regresand Noise filters)

This package adapts classic and recent filtering techniques to be used in regression problems. To do this, it uses the approach proposed in [Martin et al. (2021)](10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3123151). Thus, the goal of the implemented noise filters is to eliminate samples with noise in regression datasets.

## Install the current release from CRAN:
