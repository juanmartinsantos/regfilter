# regfilter (Regresand Noise filters)

The **regfilter** package contains several filtering techniques to remove noisy samples in regression datasets, which adapts up to a total of 14 classic and recent noise filters to be used in regression problems. To do this, it uses the approach proposed in [Martin et al. (2021)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9585469).
